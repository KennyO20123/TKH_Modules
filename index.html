	<div class="about-me-text">
		<p>Born and raised in The Bronx, I come from a backgroud where I knew education could play a pivital role in helping me achieve a better life.  Not to say that The Bronx is all gloom and doom but where I grew up was.  It was always instilled that the idea of what a "great career" was always revolved around that of a being doctor, lawyer etc.  I first came across tech when I would build websites from scratch in elementary school, back then I learned mainly the fundamentals of HTML through my own research.  Now that I know that this passion that I had (and still have) is such a coveted skill, I only see plenty of opportunities and hope in what I can consider as my "great career".</p>

		<h1>My Goals</h1>
		<p>I see myself starting out as a fullstack developer, knowing the ins and outs of front and backend code.  I eventually want to create websites and applications that are geared towards helping people and the community.  Whether it be from solving problems dealling with common everday tasks to something of a more utmost importance, I would like to be able to provide a resource that makes a difference.  The past year alone has showed us how this skill has come in handy in dealing with issues associated with Covid such as making appointments online.  I also would like to get involved in new and upcoming technology such as AR/VR and see what further possibilities lie in that field.</p>
