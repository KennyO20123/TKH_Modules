		<p>Born and raised in The Bronx, I come from a backgroud where I knew education could play a pivital role in helping me achieve a better life.  Not to say that The Bronx is all gloom and doom but where I grew up was.  It was always instilled that the idea of what a great career was always revolved around that of a being doctor, lawyer etc.  I first came across tech when I would build websites from scratch in elementary school, back then I learned mainly the fundamentals of HTML through my own research.  Now that I know that this passion that I had (and still have) is such a coveted skill, I only see plenty of opportunities with my "great career".</p>

		<h1>My Goals</h1>
		<p>My career goals are making dope things on a computer and get paid eooowwwwww (in Cardi-B voice) lol but on a serious note, I see myself starting out as a fullstack developer, knowing the ins and outs of front and backend code.  I eventually want to create websites or applications that are geared towards helping people and the community.  The past year has showed us how this skill has come in handy in dealing with issues associated with Covid such as making appointments online.  I also would like to get involved in new and upcoming technology such as AR/VR and see what further possibilities lie in that</p>
